Crizotinib was initiated and a sustained near complete response for 27 months was observed, after which an FDG-avid cervical lymph node appeared along with pleural effusions and pleural nodules. A pleural nodule was biopsied and profiled using hybrid-capture next generation sequencing, and revealed EML4-ALK variant 3 with F1245C mutation at mutant allele frequency of 2% and tumor purity of 13%.

SCID mice xenografted with H2228 were treated for 14 days with crizotinib (100 mg/kg) or ceritinib (25 or 50 mg/kg). All treatments caused tumor regression, but tumors recurred within 11 days after crizotinib treatment withdrawal. 4/8 mice treated with 25 mg/kg ceritinib showed regrowth after 1 month treatment withdrawal. The remaining 4/8 mice treated at 25 mg/kg ceritinib, and all mice treated at 50 mg/kg ceritinib maintained complete remission for four months.

This was achieved by reviewing data from two global, multicenter clinical trials of patients treated with larotrectinib: a phase II adult and young adult basket trial (NCT02576431) and a phase I adult trial (NCT02122913). The total of 20 patients with TRK fusion–positive lung cancer were treated on these trials (tumor histology was adenocarcinoma in 19 and neuroendocrine carcinoma in one patient), of which 15 were evaluable. The objective response rate (ORR) among those 15 patients was 73%: one patient had a complete response, 10 had a partial response, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease as best response. The median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 33.9 months, 35.4 months, and 40.7 months, respectively.

A TPM3::NTRK1 fusion was identified on molecular profiling, and larotrectinib was initiated on a trial. A brisk and sustained partial response was achieved. The patient discontinued treatment because of progressive disease after a durable 39 months of disease control.

Median number of mutations in the cohort was 209. 73% of patients with mutations above 209 showed DCB, while 13% of those with mutations below the median showed DCB (p=0.04). Median progression free survival was 14.5 versus 3.7 months between the two groups. In a validation group of 18 NSCLC samples, the median mutation burden was 244 in patients with DCB, and 125 in patients with no DCB. In patients with mutation burden above the median (200), there was 83% DCB with pembrolizumab, and 22% DCB in patients below the median mutation burden of 200.

This represents the first FDA approval of a systemic therapy for patients with NSCLC or pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring an NRG1 gene fusion. Efficacy was evaluated in the eNRGy study (NCT02912949), a multicenter, open-label, multicohort trial. The trial enrolled 93 adults with advanced or metastatic NRG1 fusion-positive NSCLC. Identification of positive NRG1 gene fusion status was prospectively determined by next generation sequencing assays. The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), determined by blinded independent central review according to RECIST v1.1.
